        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Abbygail Pasaribu. I am a first-year student at the Univerity of California RIveride and I am pursuing a BA in Psychology. I am a well-rounded student, and I constsntly try my best to remain organized and manage my time well. I have the self-efficacy to balance my work life, social life, and physical health. I strive to do my best in all the work I commit to and am consistently working to improve my communication and leadership skills. Throughout my entire life, I have worked to build strong relationships with people in order to gain new and different perspectives in life. This way, I remain open-minded and compassionate towards the people I build connections with. I also believe this highlights my ability to act as a mediator when conflicts arise. After taking an advanced placement Psychology class in high school, I found the topic of the human mind to be very intriguing and also enlightening. I found that I was able to find more understanding with the people I love and with the people I once disliked.<br><br>

        The reason why I chose this major is because it leads to a variety of career paths I could choose from. Psychology is the route to understanding and possibly empathizing with others. With most jobs I find interest in, they involve human interaction. For example, being a teacher for high school students is a career I definitely see myself utilizing Psychology in. I find thagt compassion and patience are qualities you develop as you come closer to understanding why humans can behave the way they do, and high school students need more understanding than anyone in this coming-of-age stage in order to succeed. I have a lot of experience working with children and youth to talk about relationships with their families, friends, and significant others. I also see myself pursuing a career as a relationship therapist, because I often find myself mediating conflicts within relationships and the resolution is always very gratifying.  <br><br>

        All in all, I really enjoy working and interacting with other people. I have the qualifications as a student in Psychology and as a person who has a genuine passion for helping others with personal growth and discovering a sense of self-actualization. Although I do not have any professional job experience, I believe the leadership workshops I attended in high school and all the personal expereinces I have gained really add up to make me qualified for an internship in Psychology, and later, with credentials, a professional job. I have experience working for my church Sunday School, and worship leader, and taking up a leadership position in my high school's community service club. Although I donâ€™t have much professional job experience, I have developed strong communication skills, work ethic, leadership skills, and a dedication to learning new skills to adapt to fast-paced working environments through volunteer and community service work.
